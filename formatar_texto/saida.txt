K-means is the most famous algorithm in clustering techniques and was first introduced by Macqueen[20]. K-means is also one of the most prominent grouping techniques in science and technology[21]. Grouping data that has the same characteristics in one cluster or grouping data groups that have characteristics different from other groups or groups so that data in one cluster or group has a small level of variation[22]. This well-known algorithm of K-means can determine the number of groups at the beginning and define a set of K centroids. The K-means K-means algorithm will in detail introduce three aspects: distance measuring, cluster centre, and algorithmic processes[23]. The abundance of K-means, in application to various data types because of its simplicity. The following steps in the K-means algorithm as follows:
